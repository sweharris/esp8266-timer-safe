This is alternate firmware for [v2](https://www.sweharris.org/post/2021-05-18-digital_safe_2/) and [v3](https://www.sweharris.org/post/2023-06-13-digital_safe_3/) safes.

This is a "timer based" safe, along the lines of a 
[Kitchen Safe](https://www.thekitchensafe.com/).


The details of the safe and how I built it is at https://www.sweharris.org/post/2023-06-13-digital_safe_3/

This repository contains the source for the Arduino sketch and a simple script to create the html "include" file from the html sources.
